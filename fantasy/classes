There are three basic class groups: Fighter, Magic User and Thief â€“ each with path specializations.

## Fighter Classes

Barbarian fighters come from the wilds outside of the civilized world. They live off of the land and fight hard to survive.

Cavalier fighters are the trained fighters of the civilized realms. As they advance to higher levels, they fill roles as knights and protectors of the realm.

Rangers are experts at tracking, hunting and living off of the land.

## Magic-User Classes

Clerics or Divine Spellcasters are the vessel of the divine casting spells by the grace of their gods

Wizards or Learned Spellcasters are wizards who harnesses the powers of magic through the sciences and chemistry.

### Rogue Classes

Thieves excel at moving about unseen and catching foes unaware, and tend to avoid head-to-head combat.

Grifters are masters of manipulating and fixing situations with their words rather than their steel.

Assassins are the shadows that strike in the night. Using poison and stealth to work their craft.

### Multi-Class Characters

Multi-class characters gain the benefits of both classes that the player choose.

Players must level up each classes together and all experience is split evenly between the classes.

Characters get Hit Points from the lower of the two classes only

Class restrictions from both classes are applied to the character

Traditional multi-class characters include:

Paladin (fighter/devine), Warmage (fighter/magic user), Bard (magic user/thief), Bounty Hunter (fighter/thief)
