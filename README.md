# simplednd-source
SimpleDnD is a roleplaying game system designed to be easy to teach, easy to learn and fast to get started. Just you and a couple of friends exploring epic adventures. In just 20 minutes you can make your own character, or just print one of the pre-generated characters and play right away.

Why is there another version of this RPG? I was turned onto GIT by another project that was using it for version control and contributions to their docs by the community. Sounds like a worthwhile experiment. Together we can build a better system.

### SimpleDnD Key Stones

+ Simplicity over all
